# Multi-Cloud  Agentic AI Infrastructure & Service Mesh

This Project repository demonstrates running Agentic AI workloads for Inferenc eusecases with a secure MCP Mesh using Istio (Ambient Mesh), SPIRE workload identity, and Kubernetes best practices. It includes Helm charts (mcp-gateway, agent orchestrator, mcp tool server), Terraform samples for EKS/kind, CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions), and Python examples.

Goals:

- Minikube/kind-friendly demo flows
- Production patterns for Istio Ambient + SPIRE
- MCP Gateway pattern for tool discovery and policy
- CI/CD example for Helm-based deployments
